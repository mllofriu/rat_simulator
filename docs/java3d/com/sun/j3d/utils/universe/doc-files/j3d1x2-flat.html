// Set the TrackerBaseToImagePlate transforms for these screens.  This
// transforms points in tracker base coordinates to each screen's image plate
// coordinates, where the origin of the image plate is defined to be the lower
// left corner of the screen with X increasing to the right, Y increasing to
// the top, and Z increasing away from the screen.
//
// Without head or sensor tracking the tracker base is still needed as a fixed
// frame of reference for describing the orientation and position of each
// screen to the others.  The coexistence to tracker base transform is set to
// identity by default, so the tracker base origin and orientation will also
// set the origin and orientation of coexistence coordinates in the physical
// world.
//
// The tracker base and center of coexistence is set here to the middle of the
// edge shared by the two screens.

// Sometimes it is desirable to include the bevels in between the monitors in
// the TrackerBaseToImagePlate transforms, so that the abutting bevels obscure
// the view of the virtual world instead of stretching it out between the
// monitors.  For a bevel width of 4.5 cm on each monitor, the above commands
// would become the following:
// 
// (ScreenProperty left  TrackerBaseToImagePlate
//                        (Translate  0.405 0.144 0.0))
// (ScreenProperty right TrackerBaseToImagePlate
//                        (Translate -0.045 0.144 0.0))
//
// Conversely, a similar technique may be used to include overlap between the
// screens.  This is useful for projection systems which use edge blending
// to provide seamless integration between screens.


// Create a view using the defined screens.

// Set the eyepoint relative to coexistence coordinates.  Here it is set 45cm
// toward the user along Z, extending out from the midpoint of the edge shared
// by the two screens.  This will create the appropriate skewed projection
// frustums for each image plate.
// 
// If a planar display surface is all that is required, the same effect could
// be achieved in a virtual screen enviroment such as Xinerama by simply
// creating a canvas that spans both screens.  In some display environments the
// use of a canvas that spans multiple physical screens may cause significant
// performance degradation, however.
// 
// See j3d1x2-rot30 for an example of a non-planar configuration that cannot be
// achieved through a single canvas spanning both screens.
